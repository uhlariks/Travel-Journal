# Code Sprint B Final Project
## Travel Journal
The motivation for this app was to create a way to keep track of past and *future* travel plans. I mostly stuck to the origianl database sketch I created, below, but I did change the date to monthVisited and yearVisited.

**What remains to be done:**
* Getting my array of "experiences" to show.
* Being able to edit and save an array of "experiences."
* Changing the color or otherwise indicating if the travel happened in the past or is planned for the future.
